# Flutter Dio API Integration Project  

This is a Flutter project that demonstrates how to fetch and display data from an external API using the powerful **Dio** package for network requests. The app retrieves product data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com) and displays it in a visually appealing, responsive UI.

## Features  
- **Fetch Data from API**: Leverages Dio for making HTTP GET requests to retrieve product data.  
- **List View**: Displays a list of products with thumbnails, titles, and prices in an elegant, user-friendly layout.  
- **Detailed View**: On selecting a product, displays detailed information including price, description, rating, and more with a smooth transition.  
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling to provide appropriate feedback when the API fails or returns invalid data.  
- **Animations**: Implements `Hero` animation for smooth navigation between the product list and detailed view pages.  
- **Responsive Design**: Cards, text, and layouts are aligned for a clean, modern, and visually appealing experience.
